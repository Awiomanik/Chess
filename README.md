## Introduction
This is a Python-based chess game project. Originally started a few years ago, this repository contains the old files and ongoing development to build a fully-featured chess game. The aim is to practice coding skills, especially python programming language and possibly ML (machine learning) while still providing an engaging and interactive chess-playing experience.

## Features
- ♟️ Basic chess game mechanics
- 🖥️ User interface for playing chess
- 💾 Save and load game states (🛠️ future implementation)
- ⏯️ View and analyze already played games (🛠️ future implementation)
- 🤖 procedural opponents (🛠️ future implementation)
- 🧠 ML opponents (🛠️ future implementation)
- 🌐 Multiplayer functionality (🛠️ future implementation)

## Installation
To get started with the Chess Game, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.6+
- Git

**Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awiomanik/Chess.git
cd Chess
```

## Usage
